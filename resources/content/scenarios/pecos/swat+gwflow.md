# Scenarios

## Overview

This page describes the scenario-analysis component of the Pecos River TxPWC dashboard. The main purpose is to evaluate how different purified produced water release strategies influence hydrology and water quality across the basin.

The scenario framework supports comparison of baseline conditions and alternative release configurations.

## Scenario Types

The Pecos River application is designed to evaluate multiple management conditions, including:

- Baseline or existing-condition simulations
- In-stream produced water release scenarios

- Land application or irrigation-related scenarios

## Key Scenario Questions

Scenario analysis is intended to support the following questions:

- How do impacts change with release location?
- How do impacts change with release timing and magnitude?
- Which reaches are most sensitive to alternative strategies?
- Which scenarios appear most protective under uncertainty?

## Release Configuration

A scenario can be defined by combining several factors, such as:

- Release point location
- Release flow rate
- Duration or timing of release
- Background hydrologic condition
- Water quality characteristics of the released water

These inputs can produce substantially different downstream and groundwater responses.

## Relevant PEST++ tools

- **PESTPP-MOU** for constrained multi-objective optimization  
- **PESTPP-SEN** for sensitivity analysis  
- **PESTPP-IES** for optimization under uncertainty  
- **PESTPP-SWP** for scenario analysis using predefined parameter or input sets 

## Dashboard Use

This page can be developed to support:

- Interactive maps of release locations
- Scenario-specific hydrographs and salinity plots
- Side-by-side baseline vs scenario comparisons
- Summary tables of key metrics
- Selection of predefined scenarios from the sidebar or page controls
